# Study on Campus
> CS 326 Group 11

Working with a study partner or group can provide increased understanding, accountability, routine, camaraderie, and productivity. However, finding an effective one can be difficult to students for a multitude of reasons: large classes, social anxiety, mismatched goals, unclear expectations, and lacking a method of contact. **We propose a web application that offers a platform that solves this issue by helping students organize study groups and more easily connect with each other.**

## Proposed Key Features
- **Study group posting:** Students can post open invites for study groups, along with their goals, preferences, and location. Users can browse and filter for groups that match their needs.
- **Private messaging:** Users can chat to discuss meeting details and coordinate plans.
- **User-reported location crowding score:** Users can rate how crowded popular study spots are to help others make more informed decisions.

## Why This Project?
- Aligns with coursework: web development, databases, UI/UX. Requires real-time updates,  authentication, and more.
- Addresses a real-world problem that students face, especially in a post-Covid world, where social interactions and development have been disrupted. Students may find it difficult to find others in their courses or major to study with due to anxiety or other reasons. Others may seek the accountability, company, and/or routine that study partners/groups can provide.
- Within scope and substantial for the course, with plenty of back-end and front-end development features for a full-stack group project.
