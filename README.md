# Study on Campus

> CS 326 Group 11

## Project Proposal
Working with a study partner or group can provide increased understanding, accountability, routine, camaraderie, and productivity. However, finding an effective one can be difficult to students for a multitude of reasons: large classes, social anxiety, mismatched goals, unclear expectations, and lacking a method of contact. **As a solution, we propose a web application that offers a platform to help students more easily connect with each other, find study locations that promote productivity, and organize or find study groups.**

## Proposed Key Features
- **Study group posting:** Students can post open invites for study groups, along with their goals, preferences, and location. Users can browse and filter for groups that match their needs.
- **Communication between users:** Users can discuss meeting details and coordinate study group plans through public comments on invite posts.
- **User-reported location crowding score:** Users can rate how crowded popular study spots are to help others make more informed decisions.
