# Study on Campus
> CS 326 Group 11

Working with a study partner or group can provide increased understanding, accountability, routine, camaraderie, and productivity. However, finding an effective one can be difficult to students for a multitude of reasons: large classes, social anxiety, mismatched goals, unclear expectations, and lacking a method of contact. **We propose a web application that offers a platform to help students more easily connect and organize study groups.**

## Proposed Key Features
- **Study group posting:** Students can post open invites for study groups, along with their goals, preferences, and location. Users can browse and filter for groups that match their needs.
- **Private messaging:** Users can chat to discuss meeting details and coordinate plans.
- **User-reported location crowding score:** Users can rate how crowded popular study spots are to help others make more informed decisions.
