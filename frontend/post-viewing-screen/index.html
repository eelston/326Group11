                with my fellow classmates for this upcoming CS 250 midterm. I am feeling 
                honestly rlly nervous and even with the SI sessions I'm still stressed.
                I am going to be at the library (floor 2) tomorrow at 9 am and gonna spend the entire
                day there studying up! Please join at any time even if you don't feel 
                supperrr ready (b/c im not either!). I'd love to meet some of my classmates!

                Anyway good luck to everyone else taking this exam in two days. :P
