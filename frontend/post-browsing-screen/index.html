                        Hi everyone! My names Melissa and I am a cs major! I am looking to study 
                        with my fellow classmates for this upcoming CS 250 midterm. I am feeling 
                        honestly rlly nervous and even with the SI sessions I'm still stressed.
                        I am going to be at the library (floor 2) tomorrow at 9 am and gonna spend the entire
                        day there studying up! Please join at any time even if you don't feel 
                        supperrr ready (b/c im not either!). I'd love to meet some of my classmates!

                        Anyway good luck to everyone else taking this exam in two days. :P
